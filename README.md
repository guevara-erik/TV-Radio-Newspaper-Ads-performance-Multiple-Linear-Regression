# Multiple Linear Regression - TV/Radio/Newspaper Ads performance on Sales

**Problem to solve:** An exciting application of regression is to quantify the effect of advertisement on sales, considering the newspaper, TV, and radio as the advertisement channels.
We will also try to predict the sales given the different parameters of advertising.

The data at hand has three features about the spending on advertising, and the target variable is the net sales.

- TV - Independent variable quantifying budget for TV ads
- Radio - Independent variable quantifying budget for radio ads
- News - Independent variable quantifying budget for news ads
- Sales - Dependent variable
